	<h1> The inside story of why Chelsea sacked Graham Potter after less than seven months </h1>
	<h2> After a tumultuous 7 months as the head coach of Chelsea Football Club, Graham Potter, who Chelsea paid over 20 million dollars to bring to London in September, saw his initial 5 year contract terminated in an admission from the Chelsea board that they made the wrong decision. </h2>
	<p><strong> James Olley </strong> </p>

	<p>
		LONDON -- Graham Potter's arrival at <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363" target="_blank"> Chelsea</a> last September was supposed to herald a new era of stability at the club after a period of unprecedented turbulence. Instead, co-controlling owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's Behdad Eghbali are looking for a new head coach less than seven months after making their first managerial appointment.
	</p>
	<p>
		The turmoil began last February, when then-owner Roman Abramovich announced his intention to pass control of the club to its trustees. This was a preemptive move that failed to prevent the United Kingdom government sanctioning Abramovich over alleged ties to Russia President Vladimir Putin, which, following the outbreak of war in Ukraine, effectively forced Chelsea's sale to trigger a whirlwind few months.

		Boehly and Eghbali completed their £2.5 billion takeover at the end of May. Tensions continued, though, as relations quickly became strained with head coach Thomas Tuchel during a frantic summer in which the club spent £270 million to sign players, the second-biggest outlay ever by any side in a single window.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tuchel was sacked less than a week after the window closed following an internal 100-day review conducted by Boehly and Eghbali that analysed all aspects of the club. Potter was identified as a progressive, innovative appointment designed to lead a long-term strategy and his arrival from <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=331" target="_blank"> Brighton & Hove Albion</a> was swift, coming barely 24 hours after Tuchel's exit.

	<p>
		On Sunday, Potter was sacked after less than seven months in charge, winning 12 of his 31 games in charge. Where did it all go wrong?
	</p>

	<p> In many ways, Potter was the opposite of Tuchel. Cynics would argue that was the case in terms of pedigree: Tuchel is a Champions League winner and lifted trophies with <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=124" target="_blank"> Borussia Dortmund</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=160" target="_blank"> Paris Saint-Germain</a> Potter's highlights included winning the Svenska Cupen and three promotions in five seasons with Swedish club Ostersunds before taking Brighton into the top half of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/league/_/name/ENG.1" target="_blank"> Premier League </a>-- the latter of which, while lacking the notoriety of Tuchel's accomplishments, was no small feat.
	</p>

	<p>
	Boehly and Eghbali saw more welcome contrasts, though. Among the reasons for Tuchel's exit was a breakdown in communications.</p>

	<p> 
	Sources have told ESPN that Tuchel had little interest in what he believed was micromanagement from above, resisting the desire for daily conversations about the team.</p>

	<p>
	Equally, Tuchel was frustrated that his influence over the club's transfer policy would be diluted as a new structure was put in place above him. There were disagreements over targets, perhaps most famously in Tuchel's reluctance to countenance a move for <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/player/_/id/22774/Cristiano-Ronaldo" target="_blank"> Cristiano Ronaldo</a> Cristiano Ronaldo, then at <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=360" target="_blank"> Manchester United</a>, despite Boehly repeatedly suggesting the transfer.</p>

	<p>
	Sources say Tuchel expected to be sacked in preseason, but the axe only fell six days after the summer window closed.</p>

	<p>
	Boehly and Eghbali went for Potter partly because they believed him to be an excellent communicator, better suited to working within the framework they were putting in place. Chelsea now have co-sporting directors in Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart along with technical director Christopher Vivell, Joe Shields, Kyle Macaulay and Jim Fraser, who are responsible for talent management and recruitment. Potter knew Winstanley from their time together at Brighton. He spent a decade with Macaulay at Ostersunds, Swansea City and Brighton...</p>
